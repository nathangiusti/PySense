**V 0.3.0 Release Notes**

- Breaking changes

    - Sisense Roles are now an enum.
        - There are many different names for a role that are used internally and externally. In an attempt to control for that, Roles are now implemented as an enum in SisenseRoles.Role. 
        - To get the role from a string, you can use SisenseRole.Role.from_str()
        - To add a user with the Viewer role you would do:
            add_user('my_user@example.com', SisenseRole.Role.from_str('Viewer'))
        - This will ensure stability around roles as Sisense terminology changes.
        - PySense.get_role_name -> PySense.get_role_by_id() 
            - This method now returns a SisenseRole.Role enum instead of a string
     
    - Many methods have been renamed
        - Some Sisense components have ids, some have oids, some have _ids, and some have multiple. When I started I wanted to see if I could remove some of the confusion by picking a single naming structure. As Sisense and PySense have grown in complexity, that goal is no longer realistic and so methods have been renamed to match their json attributes more directly.
        - In addition some methods have been renamed for brevity, clarity, and to align with the rest of PySense.
        - The parameters and usage of these methods has not changes unless noted otherwise
        - The following have been changes
            - Dashboard.get_name -> Dashboard.get_title
            - Dashboard.get_dashboard_folder -> Dashboard.get_folder
            - Elasticube.get_name -> Elasticube.get_title
            - Elasticube.get_security_for_user -> Elasticube.get_datasecurity_for_user
            - Elasticube.get_elasticube_oid -> Elasticube.get_oid
            - Folder.get_id -> Folder.get_oid
            - Widget.get_id -> Widget.get_oid
            - Group.get_id -> Group.get_oid
            
    - Undocumented endpoints have been disabled
        - When PySense first started as more of a hacked together project, I felt it would be nice to incorporate hidden endpoints. As PySense has grown it is unsustainable to keep these end points reliable. 
        - The following methods have been modified
            - DataModel.export_to_smodel no longer works on Windows
            - Elasticube.get_model no longer works on Windows
        - To manipulate datamodels in Windows, use the CLI/Prism
         
- Additions
    - A public training series is being created. The reference material for that will be stored in the PySense Tutorial folder.

- Fixes
    - More consistent version checking

- Known Issues
    - REST API sometimes becomes responsive on Linux builds
    - 0.3.0 has a large number of changes. If you encounter problems, feel free to create GitHub issues.
    - Scripts folder was updated, but due to the difficulty of testing the scripts, there may be syntax issues. If you find them, feel free to create a GitHub issue.
